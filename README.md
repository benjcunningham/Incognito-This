Incognito This!
======

Incognito This! is a service that instantly converts any open Chrome tab to a new Incognito window and vice-versa. Switching the active page to a private browsing page (or a private page back to a regular tab) is as simple as clicking the extensionâ€™s toolbar button. Incognito This! also allows for users to customize the add-on via a simple options page, providing for an even better browsing experience.

Note:
Using the Incognito This! extension in Chrome provides the same privacy and safety as using any regular Incognito tab. As an additional step to ensure a secure Incognito experience, the add-on is designed in a manner so that users do not need to give this extension permission to run in Incognito mode. However, if full functionality is desired, especially the ability to switch from Incognito tabs to normal tabs, the extension must be allowed to run in Incognito mode via the Chrome extensions manager.
